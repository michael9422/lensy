The program "lensy.c" is a experimental library for modeling geometric 
light ray paths with lenses and mirrors that have simple surfaces.

See the comments in the program source code for instructions
on compiling, running, or modifying the program. Or, do (as root):

 # gunzip lensy-1.0.tar.gz
 # tar -xvf lensy-1.0.tar
 # cd lensy-1.0
 # ./configure
 # make
 # make install

Note that compiling the program requires the SDL library and development files
to be installed.

Run the example program with:

 # ./telescope

After a few seconds, the program draws the light paths in a SDL graphics
window, and generates a FITS file of the calculated focal plane picture.

The parameters for the light source(s) and optical elements are included
in the source code. The program is designed to model the TSU echelle 
spectrograph at Fairborn observatory. It is not easily re-purposed, at this 
point.
